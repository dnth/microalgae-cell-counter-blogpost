In this blog post, I will walk you through how to use the IceVision library and train a state-of-the-art deep learning model with Fastai to count microalgae cells.

Among the things you will learn:

* Installation of the libraries.
* Prepare and label any dataset for object detection.
* Train a high-performance VFNet model with IceVision & Fastai.
* Use the model for inference on new images.

By the end of the post, you will have an object detection model that will automatically detect microalgae cells from an image.
